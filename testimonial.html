    <h3>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned where correct, if not more so, in the company I joined, I honestly feel I got every penny worth it.</h3>
    <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolleed shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched carrers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup." </p>

    <h3 style="color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);">Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
    <p style="color: hsl(224, 10%, 45%);">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn proogramming step b step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've oftenn referred to it during interviews as an example of my developemt experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack deveoper after recieving multiple offers.100% recommend!.</p>

    <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp thhemselves.Getting guidance from them and learning  from thheir experiences was easy.</h3>
    <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.The Program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You  will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
